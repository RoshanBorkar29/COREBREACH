COREBREACH

COREBREACH is a short, skill-focused sci-fi arena combat game where the player controls a combat robot trapped inside a rogue AI-controlled battle arena. The goal is to survive enemy waves, collect CORE SHARDS, and progressively override the arena system to escape.

This project is built as a compact, replayable prototype, prioritizing responsive combat, clear gameplay systems, and strong moment-to-moment feedback rather than heavy narrative or large-scale content.

🎮 Gameplay Overview

In COREBREACH, the player progresses through a sequence of enclosed arenas:

Fight waves of enemy robots using melee and ranged attacks

Dash strategically to evade damage and reposition

Collect CORE SHARDS dropped by defeated enemies

Spend shards to unlock arena exit gates or activate power nodes

Choose one upgrade after each arena clear

Fill the CORE OVERRIDE meter to unlock the final arena

Each arena applies a gameplay modifier (for example, increased damage, environmental hazards, or altered movement), ensuring variety without increasing complexity.
